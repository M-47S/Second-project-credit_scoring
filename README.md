# Second-project-credit_scoring
The second ML project,which deals with the problem of credit scoring.The project was very useful(for me)because I made a lot of mistakes in it(which I mentioned at the end of the report),it sounds funny,but its very important because at the very beginning,at least for me,mistakes are more important than successes,because only mistakes help you grow
